How the Application Works
	•	The user enters tasks into the input field and adds them to the list.
	•	Each task remains pending until marked as completed.
	•	When a task is completed, it is removed from the pending list.
	•	The progress bar updates dynamically based on the number of completed tasks compared to total tasks.
	•	The percentage displayed represents the user’s daily progress.
